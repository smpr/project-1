# project-1

Board setup: I used flexbox inside of flexbox inside of flexbox..... The center most tile was where I created the game board. I made a css class for clear red and black tiles

Initial prompts: I prompted the game to ask for player 1 and player 2 names. This changed some fields to add a small field of customization to the game.

Setting up the player swap function: I first wront a function to check and see if i could actually get it to change the class on click. after accomplishing that I made a if else statement on the conditions that player was or wasnt = red. This made it to where it changed the color and to what arrays it pushed to. This also changed the class to the appropriate player tiles. This is also where a brunt of the code is. Finding a way to condense this was a bit of a challenge to me.

Arrays on Arrays on Arrays....: this project helped me better understand the use and even the importance of multi-dimmensial arrays. I made the game board show up in a "virtual" representation in the gameLocationArray. I did this by starting out assigning each position with a function to assign every spot with a "unassigned" string so that I could test for open spots and later for a win condition.
